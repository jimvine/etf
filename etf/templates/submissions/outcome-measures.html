        Outcome measures are the things that you are measuring because you want to see how they vary. In the case of an impact evaluation, you measure how they between different interventions, perhaps because you hope that the outcome will be better with a new intervention than with the existing one.

        Anything else you measure or record is an 'other measure', to be recorded in the next section.

          <p>One option is to break the costs down by **time period**, such as by years or by quarters. In this case the cost items could simply be 'Evaluation costs in year 1', 'Evaluation costs in year 2', etc.</p>

          <p>Another option is to break the costs down by **types of activity**, for example adding cost items for 'Evaluation fieldwork', 'Evaluation analysis', etc.</p>

          <p>If you just want to record the **total cost** of the evaluation, enter 'Whole evaluation' as the item and then the total cost as the associated cost.</p>
